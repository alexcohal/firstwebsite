            <h3 id="description1"class="post_animated"> Often in my programming experience I used Java, especially in my Android Studio project, 'My Tribe' which you can view right above. I consider Java a very compact and useful programming language, but which sadly without any other designing language such as .xml along with it, it may be pretty useless in applications or ther kind of stuff. <br>
                I dare to consider myself pretty mature about my java capacities, and along with ChatGPT or simply questioning Google, I can be pretty good thanks to my creativity and speed of learning.

            <h3 id="description2"class="post_animated"> When I had to use Android Studio, I also had to learn the XML programming language. So, XML is mostly used for defining the structure of the application's design, for example buttons, titles, and anything else correlated to what you see on the screen. In my first stage of programming in Andorid Studio I barely knew how to use XML, but now, if I have to use it for some project I look like I've been working with it for years.</h3>

            <h3 id="description2"class="post_animated"> Rarely, I program in Lua for fun, in software called Roblox Studio, it's a very intresting one, since you can upload your games in the Roblox platform, which can be played by any player if you want, and also gain in-game currencies if it gets visited much. I'm pretty experienced in Lua, but I still need alot of work to master, but still, with a browser I can be invincible. But I also recognize Lua not being a really useful language for programming real projects in other softwares.

            <h3 id="description2"class="post_animated"> Yes, I also know to program in C, but not the one used for softwares, I instead use C for 'engineering' with a programming software called Arduino IDE. Pratically you write your code for the robot, you connect its motherboard and then you inject the code. It's pretty hard to know everything about C for engineering, because of its wide quantity of libraries which you may need for your robot, and so, you'll mainly have to search Google.  </h3>

                Unlike HTML, I don't know everything about CSS, since it's a way wider programming language, but still, with a great browser I can make entire projects such as the website you're looking at right now.
